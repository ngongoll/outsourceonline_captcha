OutsourceOnline Captcha

https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/outsourceonline-captcha-1.html

Spam protection for magento forms for registration,one page checkout,contactus,product review and send a friend .Simply install the module and check the aforementioned forms.There are no addtional settings to configure but it is recommended to clear your cache after installing.If you dont see admin options in configuration section logout and again login

In addtional to usual captcha check this module aslo adds option to check spam with botscout api(http://www.botscout.com/).To enable this option you just need to set the botscoupt API key(received from http://www.botscout.com/api.htm ). in admin panel.At any time you can delete the api key value and this option wil be automatically disabled

This is my first magento extension.Any valuable suggestions and help will be highly appreciated

PS:A few users reported issues on compilation which has been fixed with version 2.0.4.Now if this plugin shows issues,it will be because your are using a badly written custom theme with template overrides.If you want me to fix issue because of your custom theme,please use my paid service option by contacting me.


If any body has other issues and want to contact me to fix it,use the contact us form in my site instead of posting PMs here.If you want free support, post your issues in detail in magento forum,you may get help form many of magento experts,I myself will attend it when i have time.Private support is not free,though this plugin is. So please contact me only if you are ready to pay.Sorry but I dont have other options as I am busy with my real life obligations and it is difficult to find free time.

It has come to my notice that some of the users who installed this module are reporting certain issues.Let me assure you that this extension will definitely work on a default magento installation on a default template.Majority of those who are facing issues are either using it with a custom template and the rest who face issues are using some other custom modules whose settings mess with those of this module.For example if you enable both magento default captcha(which is incorporated from version 1.7) and install this module,it will result as a conversion killer.

If you are not tech savvy w.r.t magento and is having issues with this module,visit the webpage of this module in my site.If you want to have a foolproof installation of this module ,we could do it for a small fee of â‚¬60.Contact me through my site's contact us page

I am aware that for magento community edition 1.5 and above it shows the error

community/OutsourceOnline_Captcha: Version for 'OutsourceOnline_Captcha' was not detected

Here is the answer/solution for that

As an additional note,functionally my captcha plugin is stable and will ward of any kind of bot posts( and to some extend human spam posts).But the reason why i still set its state as 'Beta' is because for some themes, the layout files(phtml) needs to be edited due to CSS issues and in most of the cases when the user is a non techy they think that this is due to some bug in the plugin.Please check the detailed explanation below

PS:

When you install this captcha extension in a site with a custom theme,you need to edit the phtml files the concerned forms of this extension to match the custom theme as the forms are over ridden by this extension.This is applicable even if you avail only botscout protection.Visit the link below,for the list of phtml files used in this captcha extension
